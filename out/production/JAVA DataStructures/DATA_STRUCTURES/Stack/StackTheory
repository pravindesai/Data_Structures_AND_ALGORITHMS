DATA_STRUCTURES.Stack is a linear data structure which follows a particular order in which the operations are performed.
The order may be LIFO(Last In First Out) or FILO(First In Last Out).

This feature makes it LIFO data structure. LIFO stands for Last-in-first-out.
Here, the element which is placed (inserted or added) last, is accessed first.
In stack terminology, insertion operation is called PUSH operation and removal operation is called POP operation.

DATA_STRUCTURES.Stack operations may involve initializing the stack, using it and then de-initializing it.
Apart from these basic stuffs, a stack is used for the following two primary operations −

    push() − Pushing (storing) an element on the stack.

    pop() − Removing (accessing) an element from the stack.

    When data is PUSHed onto stack.

To use a stack efficiently, we need to check the status of stack as well. For the same purpose, the following functionality is added to stacks −

    peek() − get the top data element of the stack, without removing it.

    isFull() − check if stack is full.

    isEmpty() − check if stack is empty.
